# Health-Analysis

This project will look at the analysis of potential behavior risk factors that may lead to Diabetes, Hypertension, or Stroke. 
Once analysis is complteted, I will attempt to use Machine Learning to predict whether a person will have these diseases based on the behavior risks. 

The purpose of this project is to learn more about data analysis and machine learning. Seeing how a there are a lot of different ways and technique to analyze these data, I wanted to expand my skills.
